Feature / Idea	Status	Notes / Outcome
Core Functionality		
SQLite Database Integration	✅	Success. The site now runs on a fast, scalable database. This is a huge win.
Secure Admin Login (Username/Password)	✅	Success. We replaced the insecure name check with a professional, password-protected login page.
Intelligent Search Engine (TRANSLATION_MAP)	✅	Success. The search is smart and understands synonyms (sem, phy, 3rd, etc.) and is case-insensitive.
Admin Page Features		
Multi-File Drag & Drop Upload	✅	Success. The admin page is now a powerful tool for uploading multiple files efficiently.
Form Validation (Required Fields)	✅	Success. The multi-upload page correctly prevents uploads if required information is missing.
Duplicate File Handling	✅	Success. The server now intelligently renames files to prevent duplicates from being overwritten.
All New Form Fields (Time, Marks, etc.)	✅	Success. All the compulsory and optional fields you requested have been added.
UI & UX Features		
Classic Left-Aligned Terminal UI	✅	Success. The original UI was clean and effective. We are keeping this layout.
Smooth "Marquee" Progress Bar	✅	Success. The original "back and forth" progress bar animation was great. We are keeping it.
"Click-Away" Search Bar Disappear	✅	Success. The search bar fades out smoothly when you click away. This is good UX.
"F+S" Info Overlay & Animation	❌	Failed. This feature introduced layout bugs (bad spacing) and inconsistent animations. We are removing it.
Centered Layout (Home & Admin)	❌	Failed. You didn't like the look and feel. We are removing all centering styles.
Mobile-Specific UI	➖	Skipped. While we tried, it complicated the desktop experience. We are reverting to a clean, desktop-first design.
